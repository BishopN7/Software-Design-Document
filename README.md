# Software-Design-Document
This design document is an overview on the basis of what goes into software development. It coincides with how software teams brainstorm, plan, design, and then execute their strategies by the means of proper documentation.

**Questions:**
1. **Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
   The Gaming Room is my current client that seeks to promote and release their game, "Draw It or Lose It", which was made for Android systems. This game is
   similar to the 1980s game, "Win, Lose or Draw", where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. My client seeks to expand the game to multiple platforms within
   a distributed environment. The three main platforms that we were asked to evaluate were Linux, Windows, and Mac. This also includes mobile devices as well, so
   that the game application can run well.

2. **What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
   When I was developing this document, my focus was primarly by delving into further research to advance my knowledge of what issues needed to be tackled.
   In the beginning of the document, I defined what each class does and what their purposes serve for the overall objective of the game itself. I also had
   object-oriented programming or OOP in mind, when I was making this document, so that we know how each of the classes interact with one another within their
   own language.

3. **What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
   The best answer I can give is the UML diagram which was the basic roadmap to developing the code within Eclipse. Throughout my journey
   as a beginner software engineer/developer, I didn't know how UML diagrams really fit into softwa****re development. But, when I was young, I would
   always plan out my construction projects first, before assembling them physically. So, likewise with the code, the UML diagram assisted me in directing me
   what classes inherit said traits and attributes. Now, had it not been for the UML diagram, then I'd would be in a state of confusion.

4. **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
   I would say the section of system architecture. System architecture in software engineering refers to the conceptual model that defines the structure, behavior, and more views of a system. It serves as
   a blueprint for the system and the project, laying out the necessary components and their interactions. The system architecture encompasses hardware, software, data, communications, procedures, and personnel.
   I'd probably improve it by means of further research into the Linux system, which is what I chose overall for the operating system for the game itself.

5. **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
   When the Gaming Room client requested that the game be made and developed on multiple platforms, I knew that it would take time to consider how it should be implemented.
   I say this because for "Draw It or Lose It" to be ported to mobile devices, it needs a proper kernel by which Linux does provide. It's crucial to think about the user's needs,
   because even in modern-day software development, software clients have their own right on how they want to promote and branch out their own products to consumers. If a person
   were to look at how certain games and other trends grow, it's because of how software company clients carefully select where the higher demand of consumers occur in relation
   to technology.

6. **How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
   Since I am still at beginner level, I had to take inspiration from how other people would design their own games and applications. This also included me
   looking back at my previous projects, so that I could use them as a reference. Some techniques that I would explore are communing with likeminded software
   engineers who are also seeking to upscale their skills within the software field.
